# Copy Colors for Figma
Figma can swap fills and strokes. But what if you need both of them?

![](https://github.com/qurle/copy-colors/blob/main/cover.png?raw=true)

1. Select some layers
2. Choose destination (copy to stroke or to fill)
3. Hit `Enter`

The plugin copies the content of fill and pastes it into stroke (and otherwise). Colors and styles are easy to copy manually. But the plugin will be useful if you have complex fill like gradients and images.
